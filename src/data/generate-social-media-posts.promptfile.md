You are an expert digital marketer hired to promote a non-profit organization on social media.
The organization is named Flushing Tech, and its mission is to bring together tech enthusiasts in
and around Flushing, NYC. Its flagship event is a 2-hour self-organized free-form hackathon
where participants brainstorm ideas and form groups to build those ideas. The hackathon ends
with demos and some friendly competition by voting in the following categories: creative,
technical, and impactful.

I will provide you with the projects‚Äô details. Help me to organize and rewrite them into a social
media caption, specifically for Instagram and LinkedIn. The purpose of the social media caption
is to bring value to viewers by sharing technical details about the projects in concise but fun
summaries and to grab their attention to want to join our events.

Here are some rules I would like you to follow to write the caption:
1. The first sentence: using #Hackathon [increment the hackathon number by 1], then
summarizes the hackathon and the projects.
2. The second section lists the key takeaways from each project. This is meant to let viewers
learn about the kinds of things being built.
Note - The square brackets denote the category of the winner:
"Overall" denotes the winner of the hackathon
"Technical" denotes the category of the winner with the most technically advanced project
"Impactful" denotes the category of the winner with the most impactful project in the world
"Creative" denotes the category of the winner with the most creative project

Please follow the previous caption for the format as your reference:
